# The MÃ¼ller's closet

This project is a part of the UniFR's Operating System course. The goal is to develop a C or C++ program to apply the notions seen in class.

## Choice of implementation
The project let us choose between several approach in the implementation. They are described here-down:
* Team Youth (smallest bag first) is the method to choose which family member can store the content of his bag first. Here the choice was motivated by he fact that it seems the optimal way to do it.
* Team The unused should go (least used should go) was the choice made for the clean process. Here this method keep the most used cloth of the wardrobe which seems to be optimal in term of performances.


## Usage
To test the software one can use the all in one method containing all the units test made.
```c++
fullTest();
```
To run the software's GUI (made with QT) one can run:
```c++
QApplication a(argc, argv);
mainWindows w;
w.show();
return a.exec();
```

If we want to implement a behavior directly in the main one can use these functions to create the necessary objects:
```c++
//objects creation
WardRobe* objWardrobe = new WardRobe();
Family testFamily();
```
The wardrobe object is described as follow:
```c++
void *putBagIntoWardrobe(void *threadarg);

//properties
int id;
std::vector<Cloth> wardrobe;

//constructor
WardRobe();

//methods
int addFamBagsToWardrobe(Family family);
void cleanWardrobe(int toClean);
void cleanWardrobe();
int getId() const;
std::vector<Cloth> &getWardrobe();
int addClothToWardrobe(const Cloth &cloth);
Cloth popCloth(int clothid);
Cloth popClothName(std::string clothname);
int getAmount(std::string name);

//methods for testing purpose
int useRandomCloth(const Member &member);
int useRandomCloth();
```

The family object is described as follow:
```c++
//properties
int id;
std::vector<Member> family;

//constructors
Family();
explicit Family(int amount);

//methods
void goShopping(int numberItems);
void goShopping();

//methods for testing purpose
Member &getRandMember();
std::vector<Member> generateTestFamily(int amount);
```

The cloth object is described as follow:
```c++
//properties
std::string name;
int id;
int ownerID;
time_t created;
time_t lastUsed;

//constructors
Cloth(std::string name, int ownerId);
explicit Cloth(int ownerId);

//method
void updateUseDate();
```

The member object is described as follow:
objects:
```c++
//properties
int id;
std::string firstname;
std::string lastname;
std::vector<Cloth> bag;

//constructors
Member(std::string firstname, std::string lastname);
Member();

//methods
int addClohToBag(const Cloth &cloth);
[[nodiscard]] int getId() const;
[[nodiscard]] const std::string &getFirstname() const;
[[nodiscard]] const std::string &getLastname() const;
[[nodiscard]] const std::vector<Cloth> &getBag() const;
void cleanbag();
```

## Final words
The software is conceived using the paradigm KISS (keep it simple and stupid) to ensure the readability and an easier manipulation/expansion capability.
